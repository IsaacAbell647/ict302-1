## What is Vishing?

Vishing (voice phishing) is a type of scam where criminals use phone calls to trick you into revealing personal information, sending money, or granting access to your computer or accounts. Unlike email phishing, vishing relies on direct voice communication to create immediate urgency and pressure.

## Why Vishing Works

Scammers use psychological tactics that are especially effective over the phone:
- **Voice creates trust** - Hearing a human voice makes the scam feel more legitimate
- **Immediate pressure** - You have to respond in real-time without time to think
- **Caller ID spoofing** - They can make it look like legitimate organizations are calling
- **Authority intimidation** - They impersonate authoritative entities such as the police, IRS, or tech support

## Common Vishing Scams

### 1. IRS/Tax Scams
**The Scam:** Caller claims you owe back taxes and will be arrested unless you pay immediately.

**Warning Signs:**
- Threatens arrest, deportation, or license suspension
- Demands immediate payment via gift cards, wire transfer, or cryptocurrency
- Asks for credit card or bank account information over the phone
- Uses aggressive or threatening language
- Claims lawsuit is imminent

**In Reality:**
- The IRS never calls to demand immediate payment
- They always mail you first
- They never threaten arrest over the phone
- They never ask for payment via gift cards

### 2. Tech Support Scams
**The Scam:** Caller claims to be from Microsoft, Apple, or your internet provider saying your computer has a virus.

**Warning Signs:**
- Unsolicited call about computer problems
- Asks for remote access to your computer
- Wants to install "security software"
- Claims your computer is sending error messages
- Pressure to act immediately

**In Reality:**
- Microsoft/Apple never cold-call customers
- Your ISP won't call about viruses
- No one can detect viruses on your computer remotely without access

### 3. Social Security Administration Scams
**The Scam:** Caller says your Social Security number has been suspended or compromised, needing you to provide the number so you can get a new one.

**Warning Signs:**
- Claims your SSN is suspended or blocked
- Says your SSN was involved in a crime
- Threatens legal action
- Asks you to verify your SSN
- Demands payment to reactivate

**In Reality:**

**Reality Check:**

## Advanced Vishing Tactics You Might Encounter

### Caller ID Spoofing
Scammers can make any number appear on your caller ID. Just because it shows "IRS" or your bank's name doesn't mean it's legitimate.

**What to do:**
- Never trust caller ID alone
- Hang up and call the official number from the organization's website
- Don't use any numbers provided by the caller

### Faking Voices with AI
New technology allows scammers to clone voices using short audio samples from social media videos.

**Warning Signs:**
- Voice sounds slightly robotic or has odd pauses
- Background sounds are inconsistent
- Won't answer unexpected questions
- Sticks to a script

**Protection:**
- Verify through video call if possible
- Ask specific questions only the real person would know

### Number Neighbor Scams
Scammers call from numbers similar to yours (same area code and first 3-6 digits) hoping you'll answer because it looks local.

**What to do:**
- Don't answer unfamiliar numbers
- Let it go to voicemail
- Block suspicious numbers
