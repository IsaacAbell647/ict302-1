## What is Email Phishing?

Email phishing is the most common form of cyber attack, where scammers send fraudulent emails that appear to come from legitimate organizations to trick you into revealing sensitive information, clicking malicious links, or downloading malware. Billions of phishing emails are sent every day worldwide.

## Why Email Phishing Remains Effective

Despite decades of awareness, email phishing continues to work because:
- **Volume:** Billions sent daily increase chances of success
- **Sophistication:** Modern phishing emails look extremely legitimate
- **Human error:** We all make mistakes when busy or distracted
- **Evolution:** Tactics constantly adapt to security measures
- **Trust:** Email still feels more official than other communication
- **Psychological manipulation:** Exploits fear, urgency, curiosity

## Inner Workings of a Phishing Email

### Common Components:

**1. Impersonated Sender**
- Appears to be from trusted organization
- Uses logos and branding
- Similar-looking email address
- Illegitimate "From" name

**2. Hook**
- Urgent problem (account locked, suspicious activity)
- Reward or opportunity (prize won, refund available)
- Fear or threat (legal action, account closure)
- Curiosity (package delivery, document shared)

**3. Call to Action**
- Click a link
- Open an attachment
- Reply with information
- Call a phone number
- Download software

**4. Time Pressure**
- "Act within x amount of hours"
- "Limited time offer"
- "Immediate action required"
- "Account will be closed"

**5. Malicious Element**
- Fake login page link
- Malware attachment
- Data harvesting form
- Credential-stealing website


## How to Identify Phishing Emails

### Check the Sender

**1. Examine the Email Address:**
```
Displayed Name: PayPal Security
Actual Address: security@paypa1-verify.net
                               ^-- Not paypal.com!
```

**How to Check:**
- Hover over sender name (don't click)
- Look at actual email address
- Check for misspellings
- Verify domain matches company

**2. Look for Red Flags:**
- Generic/free email (gmail, yahoo)
- Similar but wrong domain (paypa1.com)
- Extra words (paypal-security.com)
- Random characters
- Wrong country domain (.ru, .cn when expecting .com)

### Analyze the Content

**Subject Line Warnings:**
- ALL CAPS
- Multiple exclamation points!!!
- "URGENT" or "IMMEDIATE"
- "Verify your account"
- "Suspicious activity"
- "Claim your prize"
- "Final notice"

**Body Text Red Flags:**
- Generic greeting ("Dear Customer")
- Spelling/grammar errors
- Awkward phrasing
- Inconsistent formatting
- Low-quality images
- Threats or extreme urgency
- Requests for personal information

### Inspect Links Carefully

**Before Clicking ANY Link:**

**1. Hover to Preview**
- Don't click - just hover
- Look at bottom left of browser
- Check actual destination

**2. Check the Domain**
```
✅ https://www.amazon.com/account/verify
❌ https://amazon-security.verify-accounts.net
❌ https://www.amazon.account-verify.com
❌ https://bit.ly/xY9kL (URL shortener hiding real destination)
```

**3. Watch For:**
- Misspellings in domain
- Extra words or subdomains
- Wrong top-level domain (.net vs .com)
- URL shorteners (bit.ly, tinyurl)
- IP addresses instead of domains
- Long random strings

### Examine Attachments

**Dangerous File Types:**
- `.exe` - Executable programs
- `.scr` - Screen savers (actually programs)
- `.zip`/`.rar` - Compressed files (can hide malware)
- `.js` - JavaScript files
- `.vbs` - Visual Basic scripts
- `.docm`/`.xlsm` - Office files with macros
- Double extensions (`.pdf.exe`)

**Safe(r) File Types:**
- `.pdf` - Usually safe, but be cautious
- `.jpg`/`.png` - Images (usually safe)
- `.txt` - Plain text
- `.html` - Can be risky if opened

**Best Practice:** Never open unexpected attachments, even from known contacts.
