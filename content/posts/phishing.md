## What is Phishing?

Phishing is a type of cyber attack where criminals pretend to be legitimate organizations to trick you into revealing sensitive information like passwords, credit card numbers, or Social Security numbers.

## Common Types of Phishing

### 1. Email Phishing
The most common form where attackers send fake emails that appear to come from banks, social media sites, or other trusted sources.

**Example Red Flags:**
- Generic greetings like "Dear Customer" instead of your name
- Urgent language: "Your account will be closed in 24 hours!"
- Suspicious sender addresses (Check carefully! Scammers can use tricks with characters to make them appear as other characters!)
- Spelling and grammar errors
- Requests for personal information

### 2. Smishing (SMS Phishing)
Phishing attacks via text messages.

**Common Examples:**
- "Your package couldn't be delivered. Click here to reschedule."
- "Suspicious activity detected on your account. Verify now."
- "You've won a prize! Claim it here."


## How to Spot a Phishing Attempt

### Check the Sender's Email Address
Hover over the sender's name to see the actual email address. Scammers use addresses like:
- `security@paypa1.com` (notice the "1" instead of "l")
- `amazon-support@secure-verify.net`
- Random Gmail or other free email addresses

### Look for Suspicious Links
Before clicking any link:
1. Hover your mouse over it (don't click!)
2. Look at the URL in the bottom corner of your browser
3. Check if the domain matches the supposed sender

**Legitimate:** `https://www.amazon.com/account`  
**Phishing:** `https://amazon-security.verify-account.net`

### Watch for These Warning Signs
- ❌ Urgent or threatening language
- ❌ Requests for passwords or financial information
- ❌ Attachments you weren't expecting
- ❌ Too-good-to-be-true offers
- ❌ Poor spelling and grammar
- ❌ Mismatched or fake logos

## What To Do If You Receive a Phishing Email

### DO:
1. Delete the email immediately
2. Report it as spam/phishing to your email provider
3. If it claims to be from a company you use, go directly to their website (don't click links) and contact them
4. Forward suspicious emails to the FTC at spam@uce.gov
5. Report to the Anti-Phishing Working Group at reportphishing@apwg.org

### DON'T:
1. Click on any links
2. Open any attachments
3. Reply to the email
4. Provide any personal information
5. Call any phone numbers in the email


## What If You Clicked?

If you accidentally clicked a phishing link or provided information:

1. **Immediately change your passwords** for affected accounts
2. **Enable two-factor authentication** if available
3. **Monitor your accounts** for suspicious activity
4. **Contact your bank** if you shared financial information
5. **Run antivirus software** if you downloaded anything
6. **Report the incident** to the FTC at IdentityTheft.gov

## Protection Tools

- **Email Filters:** Most email services have built-in phishing protection
- **Browser Extensions:** Use tools like uBlock Origin or browser built-in protection
- **Password Managers:** They won't auto-fill passwords on fake sites
- **Two-Factor Authentication:** Adds an extra layer of security

## Remember


If something seems suspicious, it probably is. Legitimate companies will never ask for sensitive information via email or text. When in doubt, contact the organization directly using contact information from their official website.
