## What is Clone Phishing?

Clone phishing is a sophisticated cyber attack where scammers create nearly identical copies of legitimate emails, websites, or social media profiles. Because the message looks familiar and trustworthy, you're more likely to fall for it.

## Types of Clone Phishing

### 1. Email Cloning

**How It Works:**
1. Scammer intercepts or obtains a legitimate email you previously received
2. They create an exact copy with minor changes
3. Usually replace legitimate links with malicious ones
4. Resend from a similar-looking email address
5. Claim it's a "resend" or "update" of the original


### 2. Website Cloning

**How It Works:**
Scammers create perfect copies of legitimate websites.

**Common Targets:**
- Banking websites
- E-commerce sites (Amazon, eBay)
- Social media login pages
- Email providers
- Cryptocurrency exchanges
- Government portals

**Cloning Techniques:**
- Copy exact HTML/CSS code
- Mirror logos and branding
- Replicate layout and design
- Use similar domain names
- Steal SSL certificates (sometimes)

### 3. Social Media Profile Cloning

**How It Works:**
1. Scammer copies your profile picture
2. Uses your name (or similar variation)
3. Copies your bio and information
4. May copy some of your posts
5. Sends friend requests to your contacts
6. Uses trusted relationship to scam people
7. May say something like "Logged out of old account" or "last account got hacked"

**Why It's Effective:**
- Your friends think it's really you
- They're more likely to trust requests
- Can gather personal information
- Access to your friend network

### 4. Phone Number/Caller ID Cloning (Spoofing)

**How It Works:**
- Scammer makes their number appear as your bank, government agency, or family member
- You see familiar number on caller ID
- Answer thinking it's legitimate
- They pose as someone you trust

## Why Clone Phishing Works

### Psychological Factors:

**1. Familiarity Bias**
- Looks like something you've seen before
- Reduces suspicion
- Feels safe and trustworthy

**2. Authority and Trust**
- Appears to come from legitimate source
- Uses official branding
- Mimics expected communication

**3. Timeliness**
- Arrives when you're expecting something similar
- References recent transactions or activities
- Creates sense of continuity

**4. Social Proof**
- "Your friend" is contacting you
- Appears verified or authenticated
- Others in your network seem connected


## How to Detect Clone Phishing

### Email Detection

**Check the Sender:**
1. **Hover over "From" name** to see actual email address
2. **Look for subtle differences:**
   - paypal.com vs paypa1.com (1 instead of l)
   - support@amazon.com vs support@amazom.com
   - info@bankofamerica.com vs info@bank-of-america.com

3. **Check email headers** (View → Show Original/Message Source)
   - Look at "Return-Path"
   - Check "Received" fields
   - Verify SPF/DKIM/DMARC authentication

**Examine the Content:**
- Compare with original email if you have it
- Look for slight wording changes
- Check for new urgency or threats not in original
- Verify links by hovering (don't click!)

**Analyze Links:**
- Hover to see actual destination
- Look for URL mismatches
- Check for URL shorteners
- Use link checking tools (URLVoid, VirusTotal)

### Website Detection

**URL Inspection:**
- ✓ Check exact spelling of domain
- ✓ Look for HTTPS (but know it's not foolproof)
- ✓ Verify SSL certificate details
- ✓ Watch for extra subdomains or words

**Visual Inspection:**
- Low-quality logos or images
- Slight color differences
- Layout imperfections
- Non-working features
- Poor mobile responsiveness

**Functional Testing:**
- Try intentionally wrong password
- See if it accepts anything
- Real sites have specific error messages
- Fake sites often just capture and redirect

### Social Media Detection

**Profile Verification:**
1. Check friend count (clones usually have few friends)
2. Look at post history (clones are usually empty or have copied posts)
3. Check creation date (recent = suspicious)
4. Verify profile photo with reverse image search
5. Look for verification badges (blue checkmarks)

**Communication Patterns:**
- Generic messages
- Unusual spelling or grammar
- Immediate requests for help/money
- Won't answer specific personal questions
- Pressures quick responses

## Prevention Strategies

### 1. Enable Security Features

**Email:**
- Enable spam filters (set to high)
- Use email authentication (SPF, DKIM, DMARC if you control domain)
- Enable link protection in email client
- Use security-focused email provider

**Social Media:**
- Enable two-factor authentication
- Set profile to private
- Limit who can search for you
- Control who can tag you
- Review friend requests carefully
- Check "Login Alerts" to see unauthorized access

**Banking/Finance:**
- Enable transaction alerts
- Set up login notifications
- Use biometric authentication
- Enable fraud monitoring

### 2. Verify Everything

**Establish Verification Habits:**
- Always go directly to websites (bookmark important sites)
- Call companies using official numbers from their website
- Verify unusual requests through secondary channel
- Check message details carefully
- Compare with previous legitimate communications

**Family/Friend Verification:**
- Set up code words for emergencies
- Verify through phone call or video chat
- Ask questions only real person would know
- Be suspicious of urgent money requests

### 3. Use Security Tools

**Browser Extensions:**
- uBlock Origin (ad/tracker blocker)
- HTTPS Everywhere
- Privacy Badger
- Netcraft Extension (anti-phishing)

**Security Software:**
- Antivirus with email scanning
- Anti-phishing protection
- Link scanners
- Password managers (won't auto-fill on fake sites)

### 4. Report and Block

**When You Find Clone:**
- Report to the platform immediately
- Block the account/sender
- Warn your contacts
- Report to authorities if appropriate
- Document everything (screenshots)

## Remember

> **If something looks familiar, verify it's not a copy.**

**Key Takeaways:**
1. Clone phishing exploits trust in familiar communications
2. Always verify sender identity independently
3. Compare with previous legitimate communications
4. When in doubt, contact the organization directly
5. Report clones immediately to prevent others from falling victim

**Trust, But Verify:**
Just because something looks legitimate doesn't mean it is. The most convincing scams are the ones that look exactly like what you expect. Take the extra time to verify before clicking, sharing, or sending money.
