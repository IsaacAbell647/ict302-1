## Why Financial Safety Matters

Financial scams cost Americans billions annually. Protecting your money online requires awareness and smart habits.

## Online Banking Security

### Essential Protections

**Must Enable:**
- ✓ Two-factor authentication (2FA)
- ✓ Transaction alerts
- ✓ Biometric login (fingerprint/face ID)

**Best Practices:**
- Use unique, strong passwords
- Never use public Wi-Fi for banking
- Use official bank apps only
- Log out after each session
- Check account activity weekly

## Card Safety Online

### Credit vs. Debit

| Feature | Credit Card | Debit Card |
|---------|-------------|------------|
| **Fraud Protection** | Excellent ($50 max liability) | Limited |
| **Dispute Process** | Easy | Difficult |
| **Account Access** | Separate credit line | Direct to bank account |
| **Best For** | Online shopping | In-person use |

**Recommendation:** Always use credit cards for online purchases.

### Safe Payment Methods

**Safest to Least Safe:**
1. ✅ Credit cards
2. ✅ PayPal, Apple Pay, Google Pay
3. ⚠️ Debit cards
4. ❌ Wire transfers (irreversible)
5. ❌ Gift cards (untraceable)
6. ❌ Cash apps to strangers

## Common Financial Scams

### Investment Scams
Guaranteed high returns, crypto opportunities, celebrity endorsements

**Red flags:** No risk promised, pressure to invest immediately, can't withdraw money

**Protection:** Only use registered advisors, if it sounds too good to be true, it is

### Romance Scams
Online relationship leads to requests for money (medical emergency, travel, business)

**Red flags:** Never met in person, professes love quickly, won't video chat, constant financial problems

**Protection:** Never send money to someone you haven't met

### Fake Check Scams
Receive check, deposit it, send some back—check bounces, you lose money

**Red flags:** Check for more than agreed, asked to wire money back, from stranger

**Protection:** Never deposit checks from strangers, wait 2+ weeks before using funds

### Charity Scams
Fake charities after disasters

**Red flags:** High-pressure, vague about money use, wants cash/gift cards

**Protection:** Research on CharityNavigator.org, donate through official websites only

## Identity & Credit Protection

### Monitor Your Credit

**Free Reports:** AnnualCreditReport.com
- One per year from each bureau (Equifax, Experian, TransUnion)
- Check every 4 months (rotate bureaus)
- Look for: unknown accounts, suspicious inquiries, wrong info

### Protection Options

**Fraud Alert (Free, 1 year):**
- Call one bureau: Equifax 1-888-766-0008, Experian 1-888-397-3742, TransUnion 1-800-680-7289
- They notify the others
- Creditors must verify identity

**Credit Freeze (Strongest, Free):**

### Identity Theft Warning Signs

**If this happens:** Place fraud alert, file report at IdentityTheft.gov, file police report, change all passwords
