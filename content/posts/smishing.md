## What is Smishing?

Smishing (SMS + Phishing) is a cyber attack where scammers send fraudulent text messages to trick you into revealing personal information, clicking malicious links, or sending money. Text messages feel more personal and urgent than emails, making smishing particularly effective.

## Why Smishing Works

### Psychological Factors:
- **Trust in texts** - We assume texts come from real people
- **Immediate urgency** - Texts demand quick responses
- **Mobile vulnerability** - Harder to verify links on phones
- **Personal device** - Phones are with us 24/7
- **Less suspicious** - We're more cautious with emails than texts
- **Direct delivery** - No spam folder to filter messages

## Common Smishing Scams

### 1. Package Delivery Scams

**The Message:**
```
"USPS: Your package is waiting for redelivery. 
Confirm your address here: [link]"

"FedEx: Delivery attempted. Schedule redelivery: [link]"

"Your package has been held at customs. 
Pay $2.99 fee to release: [link]"
```

**Red Flags:**
- You weren't expecting a package
- Asks for personal information or payment
- Generic greeting
- Short link (bit.ly, tinyurl, etc.)
- Sense of urgency

**What They Want:**
- Credit card information
- Personal details for identity theft
- Install malware on your phone

### 2. Bank Account Alerts

**The Message:**
```
"ALERT: Unusual activity detected on your account. 
Verify now to prevent suspension: [link]"

"Your card ending in 4523 has been locked. 
Confirm your identity: [link]"

"FRAUD ALERT: $487.92 charged to your account. 
Not you? Click here: [link]"
```

**Red Flags:**
- Creates panic about your money
- Demands immediate action
- Link to "verify" your account
- Comes from random number, not bank's official shortcode

**What They Want:**
- Online banking credentials
- Card numbers and CVV
- Social Security number

```
"Congratulations! You've won a $500 Walmart gift card! 
Claim here: [link]"

"You've been selected as our lucky winner!

```

"Mom, my phone broke. This is my new number. 
I need money for the repair. Can you Venmo me?"

Can you send $200 to this Cash App?"
```
