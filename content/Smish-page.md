# What is a Smishing Attack?
A smishing attack is a from of cyberattack where scammers will use deceptive text messages to trick people into revealing sensitive information like passwords, credit card numbers, or Social Security numbers.These attacks often create a sense of urgency or fear and contain malicious links to fake websites or prompts to download malware.
# How does a Smishing Attack Work?  
Smishing attacks work in a few different ways
* Impersonation: Smishing texts often pretend to be from a trusted source, such as a bank, government agency (like the IRS), or a delivery service. 
* Social engineering: They use psychological tactics like urgency ("Your account is compromised!") or curiosity ("You've won a prize!") to manipulate the recipient. 
* Malicious links: The texts frequently include a link that, when clicked, takes you to a fraudulent website designed to look legitimate to steal your login credentials. 
* Harmful downloads: Clicking the link could also trigger a download of malware onto your device, which can then be used to steal information. 
# Common signs of a smishing attack 
* Messages that create a sense of urgency to get you to act quickly. 
* Requests for personal information like passwords, credit card numbers, or Social Security numbers. 
* Links that look suspicious or don't match the official website address. 
* Poor spelling and grammar, though some attacks are sophisticated and may not have errors. 
* Promises of rewards or money that seem too good to be true. 
# What to do if you receive a suspicious text 
* Whatever you do **DO NOT** click on any links.
* Do not reply to the text message.
* Do not provide any personal information.  
* If the message is from a company you do business with, contact them directly through a known, official channel to verify the message's legitimacy.
